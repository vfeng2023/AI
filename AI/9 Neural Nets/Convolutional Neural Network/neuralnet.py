    What function is supposed to do:
    Using NumPy, we can program the convolution operation quite easily. 
    The convolution function makes use of a for-loop to convolve all the filters over the image. 
    Within each iteration of the for-loop, two while-loops are used to pass the filter over the image. 
    At each step, the filter is multipled element-wise(*) with a section of the input image. 
    The result of this element-wise multiplication is then summed to obtain a single value using NumPyâ€™s sum method, 
    and then added with a bias term.
